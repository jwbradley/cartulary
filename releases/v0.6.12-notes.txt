#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.12


Catching up on old times.

This is a big time catchup release.  The biggest improvements here are structural.  But there are some
visible things as well.


- Bug Fixes
    - Improved updater script
    - Lots of fixes in the river template scripts
    - Fixed imgur.com parsing in cartulize script
    - Re-enabled search v2 word map building
    - OPML expansion state bug in rendered html
    - Better defense on some RSS enclosure edge cases
    - Fixed multiple bugs with RDF handling in the aggregator

- New Feature: Unsticky All Button in River
    - Does what it says.  Unsticky all posts at once.

- Improvements
    - Save as... button in the editor now operates like a normal save as button by saving the outline
      and then opening the new version, leaving the old one un-touched.
    - Lots of structure changes to the app directory layout.
    - Better handling and rendering of media uploads in the editor.
