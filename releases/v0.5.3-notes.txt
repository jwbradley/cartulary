#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.5.3


New features:

- Open Registration.  There is a new flag in the cartulary.conf file called "cg_opensignup".  If you set
  this flag to 1, your server will allow other people to create their own user accounts through a new
  registration page.

  For security, there is another setting called "cg_opensignup_phrase" that you will need to set.  This
  phrase is required to be put in upon registering.  It'd be a good idea to change it periodically.

  Again, for security, only 1 successful registration per ip address is allowed per 48 hours.  And, only
  4 un-successful attempts are allowed per 48 hours.

- Hiding your subscription list from your social outline.   Some people might not want the list of what
  they subscribe to being public.  So, from the prefs page you can now set the "I don't want my subscription
  list in my social outline" checkbox.  Setting this will eliminate the "Stuff I Follow" section from your
  social outline.

Improvements:

- Removed feed scanning from the buildrivers script.  It would get very bogged down when someone brought in
  a bunch of new feeds.

- Fixed a caching bug on mobile with stickies coming back.

- A bunch of other, smaller bug fixes.
