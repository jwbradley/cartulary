#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.7.3


This is a bugfix release for a problem with the news river page.  This reverts the real-time pulling and puts
it back to river.js/jsonp for now until I can work out what the problem is.

This release also includes some tweaks to cartulizing to improve extraction.
