#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.5.4


This release has two focuses:  database/speed improvements and baking in the Concord outliner.

- A big table change.  The relations between nfitems table and the nfitemprops table is now such that
 we can use the nfitemprops table as a lookup table to build rivers very quickly.  This essentially
 eliminates the need for the multiple table JOIN approach that was being used and speeds river build
 time way up.  It's still a little too slow for real-time building, so we still pre-build them every
 5 minutes.  Hopefully I can continue to improve the speed enough to make real-time feasible.

- Concord!  Since Dave Winer released his Concord outliner under the GPL it just makes sense to bake
 it into Freedom Controller.  To that end there is a new Editor page in the menu bar.  You can create
 new outlines and save them as OPML/HTML directly into your S3 bucket.  You can also export a batch of
 saved articles straight into the editor for easy editing.  This would be good if you wanted to take an
 article you had saved and mark it up.  This is just scratching the surface.  Expect lots more work on
 the editor in the future.  Thanks Dave!

- Brought back the "Me" page and called it Profile.  It's listed under the user menu if you click on your
 avatar.  You can use this page to publish feeds to your social outline.

- Other changes:
    - rssCloud is now off by default.  It's rapidly disappearing from the net in favor of pubsubhubbubb.
    - Changed the way we poll other FC servers to ensure that we don't end up with dead or multiple
      copies of the same server in the list.
    - Some other bug fixes.
