#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.17



- Bug Fixes (the notable ones)
    - We should have been checking HTTP status code when adding enclosures to RSS feeds in the editor.  If the enclosure
      url HEAD check returns a greater than 399 status code then error out.
    - Change domain refs in blank RSS outline template to point to a subdomain we own to prevent hijacking in the future.

- New Feature: Editor - private outlines
    - There is now an option in the editor toolbar to make an outline private. Default is always "public" in the S3 bucket.
    - Just click on the circle with the slash through it and then save the outline.  The OPML will be marked private in S3 and the HTML
      will be removed from S3.
    - The HTML link will then be replaced with a server-referenced url with a 75 character random token.  This can be shared
      for private viewing.

- New Feature Editor - Unarchive nodes
    - If you have an "include" type node selected, you can click the unarchive button on the toolbar to suck the included outlines
      nodes back into this outline and remove the include reference.
    - If you have multiple include nodes selected they will all be sucked back in.
    - This is very useful if you produce a search outline with the 'OPML:' search keyword and want to turn it into a single large
      outline without all the includes.


- Improvements:
    - Editor now prompts if you want to "save as..." when you save after changing the title of an outline.
    - Editor prompts if you're sure you want to leave the page if you have unsaved changes.
    - Updated Font-awesome to latest version.
    - Removed morse code tool from editor.
