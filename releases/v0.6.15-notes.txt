#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.15



- Bug Fixes
    - There was a major breakage to the new search version 2.  I can't find where it was
      introduced but it pretty much broke the whole thing.  That's fixed now.

- New Feature: OPML export in search results
    - You can now add the "opml:" keyword to any search string.  That will add a little
      opml icon to the search result window which you can click on to send those results
      to the editor as an opml file which you can save, edit, etc. just like any other
      opml document.
    - An example search might look like this "clinton trump 2016 opml: max:200"
    - That would return a max of 200 results (default is 100) and give you an opml export
    - This technique should work on all sections that have search enabled (river, articles,
      opml, editor, subscriptions)
