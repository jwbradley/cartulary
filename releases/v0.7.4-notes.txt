#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.7.4


The primary focus of this release is on improvements to article content extraction and workarounds for problem feeds
in the aggregator.


- Bug Fixes (the notable ones)
    - Longstanding bug where sometimes HTTP headers would show up in the body of a carted article
    - Big bug in redirection detection when a meta refresh tag was being used
    - Two sql argument ordering typos in Aggrivate that kept the feed from updating correctly

- Improvements:
    - There is now an email link on the article page for easier handling of that activity
    - Styling improvements in carted articles in the river and on article page
    - Tons of tweaking to the way carted articles are converted after parsing
    - Lots of improvements to article extraction
    - The system now checks for available FC upgrades and puts a notice in the admin feed
    - Feedscan now tries more ways to fix feeds that aren't encoded right or have invalid structure
