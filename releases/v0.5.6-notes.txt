#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.5.6


##This release has one focus: improving the editor.


##There are two new user prefs.
  - Disqus Shortname:  This is used for enabling disqus comments on pages you publish using the editor.
  - Analytics code:  Whatever html or text you put here will be injected at the bottom of every html body
                     of editor documents AND url shortener files for s3.  You can use this for adding 
                     analytics to editor documents and short urls.


##The editor has a new sub-menu that controls everything.
  - New: Creates a new, empty file that replaces what you currently have.  No prompt to save.
  - Open: Drops down a list of the files you've recently worked on so you can re-open them.  You can also
          open an opml file by url using this.
  - Save: Saves the file and writes an opml and html version to your s3 bucket.
  - Rename: Save the file under a different file name.
  - Template: Apply an outline containing a "replace" node to another outline. The content of the current
              outline replaces the "replace" type node in the template.
  - Publish: Brings up the Microblog modal so you can push it to your microblog feed and/or twitter.
  - WYSIWYG: Toggles html rendering on for the outline your working on.
  - Type: Sets the node you currently have selected to the type you choose.
  - Disqus: Enables disqus comments for the html version of this outline.
  - Redirect: Writes a stub file to an S3 bucket containing a meta redirect to the html version of an outline.
  - Link Icon: Sets selected text as a hyperlink.
