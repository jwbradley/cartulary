#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.6.16



- Bug Fixes (the notable ones)
    - There was a big bug in handling non-us regions in AWS.  I was using a third-party S3 library and didn't
      realize that AWS had implemented a new API signing version (v4) in recent years.  All new AWS regions
      require v4 signatures.  All older regions still support v2.  This release updates all S3 calls to use the
      newest AWS SDK and v4 signing.  It also uses multi-region safe calling.  It's a little slower than the old
      library but it "just works", so I'll take it. :-)  Thanks to Dan Curry for first spotting this bug, and
      Frank Meeuwsen for helping me test the new fix.

- New Feature: Version history in the Editor
    - One thing that has bugged me for a while is how easy it is to accidently save over top of an existing outline
      when you intended to do a "save as" but forgot out of habit.  Now, there is a version history option that will
      let you open up any historical version of an outline so you can recover if this happens.
    - You just click the version history button and choose which one you want to open.  It will open in a new window.
    - Once you open it, just click save and that outline is restored to that version.
    - You can then go back to the other tab and do a proper "save as..." on your modified version.
    - This feels like the right solution.  I'd love some feedback on it.

- New Feature: JSONfeed support
    - You can now subscribe to JSONfeed feeds.  Internally, I'm just converting the JSONfeed back to RSS2 and then
      passing it on in to the parser.  It's a little inefficient but gets the job done without having to rewrite a
      bunch of aggregator code that expects to be passing XML objects around.
    - These feeds are also surfaced on the subscribe bookmarklet.
    - The JSONfeed spec is here: [https://jsonfeed.org/]
    - The PHP function I wrote to convert JSONfeed to RSS2 is here:  [https://gist.github.com/daveajones/be26f5ca9cb7559d0c33549b53323770]

- Improvement: Rotate uploaded images based on Exif data
    - This should be on the [Should have happened 3 years ago] list.  :-)
