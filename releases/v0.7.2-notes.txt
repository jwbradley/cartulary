#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.7.2


This release is again focused on the aggregator, but with some significant cartulizing improvements also.


- Bug Fixes (the notable ones)
    - Aggregator wasn't handling gzip compression correctly
    - Updated Twitter to use 280 characters
    - Shortened the enclosure check timeout when building rss feed from editor
    - Better defense on cron job lock checking

- Improvements:
    - The river page now pulls directly from the live database instead of pre-built river.js files
    - Switched the cartulize engine from FiveFilters to Readability ported from Mozilla
    - The aggregator is now much more efficient with feed change detection, using a cascading date change detection.

- Readability Cart Engine:
    - The heart and soul of this system is the Cartulizing engine that saves articles as you read them in your news river.  There
      were plenty of times that this article saving ("cartulizing") would fail.  I began testing the php port of Mozilla's Readability
      library and it works well on some articles that the FiveFilters engine fails on.  Instead of simply replacing one with the other
      it now tries Readability first and, if that fails, redirects to FiveFilters.  We now get two full shots at grabbing the article.
