#Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.7.1


This release is mainly focused on the aggregator and how it handles dead feeds.


- Bug Fixes (the notable ones)
    - Many bug fixes in the aggrivate.js aggregator.
    - Fixed a title logic error when setting filename for a new outline

- Improvements:
    - The aggregator now purges feeds that have more than 1000 errors AND haven't had a good HTTP status code in over 30 days.
    - For social outline connected feeds, the dead feeds are just flagged as such in the newsfeeds table
