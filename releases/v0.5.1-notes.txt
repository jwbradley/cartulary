Release Notes - Freedom Controller v0.5.1


This is mostly a server maintainence and bug fix release.  Here's a run down:

- Removed all of the hard coding of "/opt/cartulary" so putting the app in a different
  folder is now much less of a headache.
- The feed scanner now reports subscriber count in the user agent string.
- Meta-refresh interval on S3 shortened links is now zero, per @JoeMoreno recommendation.
- Fixed some river bugs with un-stickying items
- Added an option to encrypt database backups using AES-256.  Look in the [security] section
  of cartulary.conf for:
  cg_backup_encrypt:  1 for yes, 0 for no
  cg_backup_encrypt_password:  you'll use this password if you ever need to recover
- Fixed a bug with mobile in-river carting pref
- Switched to sessionStorage for river data instead of localStorage
- Bug fix with blog tools pane not showing up if there were no blog posts
- Fixed style sheet problem on mobile version of subscribe page
- Fixed jumping to new feed on manual subscribe
- Fixed a syntax error in the river item templates
- Set the in-river carting on mobile option to default to true now that we're not
  using modals
